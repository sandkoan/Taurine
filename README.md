A New Collaborative Quiz Bowl Packet Editor

- The successor to Garuda.
- Completely rewritten in Node.
- Designed around a RESTful API.
- Probably filled with bugs galore.

### Credits
I'd like to thank my Quiz Bowl teammates and coaches for their tireless usage and
constructive criticism; it's not always easy trying untested software in a production
environment. I'd also like to thank Charles Hang for offering several usability
suggestions along the way.

### The Name
NAQT's famed packet editor for internal use is called Ginseng. Since this vainly
aims to be a public alternative for the average housewrite, I decided to name it
after a different herbal energy supplement.

### Contributing
I hope that my personal coding style is consistent enough to be reckoned with by
an outside observer. If you're interested in porting my client code to Android or
another mobile platform, please let me know and I will try to clarify the API for
you. Ideally I should do that anyway.
